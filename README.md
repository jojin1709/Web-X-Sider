## 🚫 Noise Protection (Smart Filtering)

Web X Sider automatically excludes architectural noise to focus on valuable recon:

- **Static Assets**: Blocks `*.png`, `*.css`, `*.woff`, `*.svg`, etc.
- **Social & Analytics**: Filters LinkedIn, Facebook, Google Analytics, GTM, etc.
- **Known CDNs**: Ignores common libraries from jsDelivr, cdnjs, unpkg, etc.
- **Invalid Prefixes**: Excludes `data:`, `blob:`, `mailto:`, `tel:`, etc.

## 🧪 Usage Guide

### Local Run

For local testing, use the included Python server so the crawler and prober can fetch target URLs through the local `/proxy` endpoint:

```bash
python server.py 5501
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5501/
```

Opening `index.html` directly, or serving with plain `python -m http.server`, can load the website but break the tools because browsers block cross-origin requests.

### 🕷️ Smart Crawler

1. Visit **[https://iamshafayat.github.io/Web-X-Sider/](https://iamshafayat.github.io/Web-X-Sider/)**
2. Enter a target URL (e.g., `https://example.com`).
3. Click **Scan Page** for a quick analysis or **Full Scan** for recursive domain discovery.
4. Monitor the **Dashboard** to see live extractions of Endpoints, Parameters, Secrets, and Files.
5. Use the **Category Tabs** to filter results and the **Global Search** for specific keywords.
6. **Export** your findings in `.txt`, `.json`, `.csv`, or `.md` formats.

### 🛡️ Sensitive Path Prober

1. Switch to the **Sensitive Path Prober** tab from the header menu.
2. Enter the target domain (e.g., `https://example.com`).
3. Click **Check Paths** to start probing **500+ critical paths** (e.g., `.env`, `.git`, `phpinfo.php`).
4. Watch the **Progress Bar** and live **Status Counters** (200, 403, 404).
5. Use the **Status Filters** (Found, Forbidden, Missing) to analyze the detected paths live.
6. **Advanced Filtering**: Use the **Include/Exclude Lengths** inputs to filter out standard WAF block pages by their byte size (e.g., exclude `127, 403`).
7. 🔗 Use the **OPEN🔗** buttons to instantly verify 200 and 403 leaks in a new tab.
